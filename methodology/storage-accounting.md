# Frozen candidate: storage accounting

`producer-normalize-v1` is the only implemented schedule; no build option selects it. It replaces COPY/OUTPUT/RELEASE with WRITE/NORMALIZE, reprices DIV and removes DISCARD, FINAL and SIGHASH charges, matching BIP 440/441. A production event is a specified semantic value/result, not each allocator call. Reuse may conservatively pay production again; capacity never enters a charge.

| Path | Production/lifetime accounting | Other work / check |
|---|---|---|
| Initial witness values | WRITE once per item after immediate-success prescan | Empty items included; early success bypass unchanged |
| Literal/scalar push | WRITE(bytes); scalar uses NUMERIC_RESULT(8) | Fixed opcode cost; numeric materialization for scalar |
| DUP/OVER/PICK/TUCK families | WRITE once per new copy | Count conversion or truth check as applicable |
| DROP/NIP/2DROP, final cleanup | No separate release | Lifetime funded by original producer |
| ALTSTACK, SWAP/ROT/ROLL | No new production | MOVE prices ownership/header changes |
| CAT growth | WRITE(full result), even if allocation reused | Inputs were funded independently; growth is not free |
| SUBSTR | WRITE(result) once | Index PREPARE/READ; source/index release already funded |
| LEFT/RIGHT shrink | WRITE(result) once | Pushing may copy the result out of the old buffer; original producer funds releasing it |
| Numeric/bit results, comparisons, MIN/MAX | NUMERIC_RESULT(n) = WRITE(W(n)) + NORMALIZE | PREPARE/kernel work separately; no second RELEASE |
| MUL | WRITE(full result span) + PREPARE(result span) + WRITE(scratch row) before kernel | Row/accumulation kernels exclude these allocations; only NORMALIZE at output |
| DIV/MOD | DIV includes internal scratch and normalization | External result uses NUMERIC_RESULT; do not add kernel scratch again |
| Hash/key result | WRITE(digest/key bytes) | Hash/tweak helper writes prepared output; does not insert on stack |

The numeric output production is a conservative semantic charge even when the input allocation is reused. This is distinct from accidentally charging both an explicit RELEASE and a lifetime-inclusive WRITE. PREPARE tight-capacity growth is checked by finite source-to-result lifetimes, not an allocator-dependent extra formula. Known lifetime-fit underpredictions remain evidence to validate across machines; this ledger alone does not prove timing coverage.

Retained capacity is bounded: `ValtypeStack::push_back(valtype&&)` copies a value whose capacity exceeds twice its word-rounded length into a word-rounded buffer. Every path that can shorten a value pays production of its result (LEFT/RIGHT/SUBSTR, numeric/scalar results, MUL's prepaid span), so the copy is always funded. Creating and then shortening a value is therefore two productions; WRITE is fitted without shrink fixtures, and `PRODUCE/churn` measures the pair. Stack element storage is therefore at most twice the word-rounded logical bytes, plus vector headers and allocator overhead. Every producer (literal pushes, OP_1..OP_16, CAT, SUBSTR, digests, OP_TX, numeric results) reserves `WordPaddedCapacity(n)` before filling a value, so pushing it, or later preparing it as a number, never reallocates; the reserve in `push_back` only guards values that did not. The PRODUCE fixtures build values the same way.

Regression checks: `producer_lifetime_accounting` covers initial values, empty values, moves/drops, shrinkage and multiplication preflight; `producer_composition_boundaries` covers CAT, SUBSTR, ADD carry growth and SUB borrow shrinkage with exact and one-short budgets around byte/word/allocation boundaries; `shortening_splice_costs` covers LEFT/RIGHT; `valtype_stack_move_bounds_retained_capacity` covers the capacity bound. `bench_varops --verify-costs` checks independent formulas and exact budgets across generated scripts.

OP_TX/macros are postponed. Their experimental storage paths and existing prices are not finalized by this audit.
